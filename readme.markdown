Simple demonstration of having a custom table cell with Teacup
==============================================================

In my own project, I wanted to create a custom subclass of the
UITableViewCell to wrap the presentation and events from a
single table cell. It did take quite a few trial and error
before I got it to work as I wanted.

Therefore I created this example app to show how I got it to work,
so others may benefit from my experience.

Building instructions
---------------------

To build the app, use bundler to install the requirements

 * gem install bundler [if you don't have bundler installed already]
 * bundle install
 * rake

That should launch the app ;)

If there is something that could have been done smarter, perhaps
because of updates to Teacup, please let me know, so they can
serve as good examples.
